## Description:

So this is an basic global messaging app in which any **individual** can chat with anyone online on the website.

This web-app is written in **PHP**.

1. **PHP** version 7.0.0 .
2. A working web server(**apache**), i am doing it for practice purpose so i am using **XAMPP** on localhost.
3. For database, i am using **MySQL** server.

## Database Instructions(**Make shure to have the exact database details as mentioned**):
 
1. Create a database of name **'messenger'**.
2. Create a table of name **'accounts'**, and the column names are **'id', 'name', 'password'**(auto-increment the id column).
3. Create a table of name **'chat'**, and the column names are **'id', 'name', 'message', 'time'**(auto-increment the id column and set the type of time with **datetime** with the default value of **CURRENT_TIMESTAMP**).
